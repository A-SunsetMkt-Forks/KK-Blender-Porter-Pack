# KK Blender Scripts
Scripts and a shader to get you started with setting up an exported Koikatsu character in Blender. 
#
The ```1-4 scripts``` are for doing various things. You paste them into Blender's scripting tab.

```99 KK shader``` is a .blend file that contains the shader and some material examples 

```999 example card``` was the card used to create the material examples in the .blend file.  
If you export this card and some textures, you should be able to use the pre-existing materials in the .blend file to have this particular character completely set up for you.  
(couldn't find the name of the author because their cards link went down)
