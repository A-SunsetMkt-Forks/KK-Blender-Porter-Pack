# KK Blender Scripts
Scripts and a shader to get you started with setting up an exported Koikatsu character in Blender.  
Meant to be used with this video tutorial: https://youtube.com/watch?v=hT_BvNISFiM
#
The ```1-4 scripts``` are used for various things. They're meant to be copy-pasted into Blender's scripting tab.

```99 KK shader``` is a .blend file that contains the shader and some material examples. 

```99 KK shader V2``` is a slightly updated version of the KK shader.

```999 example card``` was the card used to create the material examples seen in ```99 KK shader.blend```.  
If you export this card and some textures, you should be able to use the pre-existing materials in the .blend file to have this particular character completely set up for you.  
(couldn't find the name of the author because their cards link went down)
