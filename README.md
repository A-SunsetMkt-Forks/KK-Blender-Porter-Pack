# KK Blender Porter Pack
Plugin pack for exporting and setting up Koikatsu characters in Blender.  

The ```KKBP exporter for Koikatsu``` is used to export the character's mesh, armature and color data. The exported data is then processed by the ```KKBP plugin for Blender```. Once characters are setup in Blender, they can be saved as FBX files for use in other programs.

**Don't mix KKBP Exporters and KKBP Blender Plugins from different releases! For example, if you are using KKBP release 6.6.3, you must use KK-Blender-Porter-Pack-V6.6.3.zip with KKBP_Exporter_V4.30.zip**
|    Game   | Plugin version | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Koikatsu<br />Koikatsu Party  | Use the .dll file in the net3.5 folder     | 
| Koikatsu Sunshine   | Use the .dll file in the net4.6 folder   |

1. Start the game, go to the character creator and load your character
1. Click the "Export Model for KKBP" button on the top of the screen. This may take a few minutes depending on your hardware. A folder will popup when the export is finished

#### Exporting from Blender to fbx:

<details><summary>Click to expand!</summary> 

1. Save a backup file of your finished model
1. Choose which export type you want in the KKBP panel. There's currently a targeted export type for Unity (VRM and VRChat), and a generic fbx type for everything else
1. Click the "Prep for target application" button
1. Click the "Bake material templates" button and choose the folder you want to store all of your baked images to (warning: there's going to be a lot, so an empty folder is recommended)
1. Create an altas for the body, clothes and hair objects using the [material combiner](https://github.com/Grim-es/material-combiner-addon) addon
1. Hit the undo button to return to the state before you created the atlas. Change the menu under the "Apply baked templates" button from "Light" to "Dark" and click the button to load in the dark textures. Use material combiner again to generate the dark version of the material atlas 
1. Click the export FBX button in the KKBP panel to invoke the built-in fbx export dialog
